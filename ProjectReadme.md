# Project: Open Access Library System (React + Shadcn UI)

This project aims to create a web-based Open Access Library System utilizing **React** and **Shadcn** (an open-source UI library). The system features a responsive design with a left-aligned logo and contact information (email, address, etc.) on the right. A navigation bar connects all major sections, providing an intuitive user experience.
